# Goldbach Decomposition Tool

This public tool allows users to decompose any even number **E > 4** into a sum of two prime numbers (p + q = E), in accordance with **Goldbach's Conjecture**.

The algorithm is designed to be simple, fast, and accurate for numbers up to **10^16** or more, depending on device performance. It uses a deterministic method to test prime pairs efficiently.

## Features

- Decomposes even numbers into two primes (p + q = E)
- Fast response for even numbers â‰¤ 10^16
- Works in any modern web browser
- Lightweight design with red-themed styling

## About the Author

This method and tool were developed and made public by **Bahbouhi Bouchaib**, independent researcher in mathematics based in Nantes, France.

## Usage

1. Enter an even number greater than 4.
2. Click **Decompose**.
3. The tool returns one valid prime pair (p, q) such that p + q = E.

## Disclaimer

This tool is part of a broader mathematical exploration. The method is public and free to use for educational and scientific purposes.
